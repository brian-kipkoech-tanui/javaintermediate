        //         It is ordered, meaning the order in which we add elements remains the same as their
        //         position when we retrieve them.
        // 2. Set: A collection of unique elements (no duplicates). It does not support
        //         indexing or ordering since it doesn't maintain any specific order for its elements.
        // 3. Queue: A collection following First-In-First-Out (FI
        //           Out) principle i.e., the element added first will be removed first.
        // 4. Stack: A collection following Last-In-Last-Out (LIFO
        //            principle) i.e., the element added last will be removed first.
